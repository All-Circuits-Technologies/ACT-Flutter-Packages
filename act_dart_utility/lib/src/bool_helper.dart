/// String parsing methods
/// ----------------------
///
/// Others basic types feature both
/// - a toString function which encodes a value as a String
/// - a parse/tryParse pair which decodes the string into a value
///
/// Unfortunately Dart [bool] only features a toString at the time of writing.
/// This helper provides those two missing functions.
///
/// Extending [bool] type
/// ---------------------
///
/// Extending bool type (to inject parse functions in it for example)
/// is unfortunately prohibited by Dart.

  /// The [source] is expected to be either "true" or "false", whichever case

  ///
  /// This method is compatible with [bool.toString] since it recognize strings
  /// generated by [bool.toString] (and a few more).
