# ACT Flutter Packages Monorepo

Always follow these instructions first and fallback to search or bash commands only when you encounter unexpected information that does not match the info here.

## Working Effectively

### Essential Setup Commands
- Install Flutter SDK (required for all operations):
  ```bash
  # Method 1: Clone Flutter (most reliable)
  cd /tmp && git clone --depth 1 --branch stable https://github.com/flutter/flutter.git
  export PATH=/tmp/flutter/bin:$PATH
  # Add to your shell profile: echo 'export PATH=/tmp/flutter/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.bashrc
  
  # Method 2: Use package manager (if snap is available)
  sudo snap install flutter --classic
  
  # Verify installation
  flutter doctor  # NEVER CANCEL: Takes 3-5 minutes on first run. Set timeout to 10+ minutes.
  ```
- Install mono_repo (monorepo management tool):
  ```bash
  dart pub global activate mono_repo
  ```
- Set up package dependencies:
  ```bash
  # Use the provided script to install all package dependencies
  ./tool/pub_get_all.sh  # NEVER CANCEL: Takes 10-15 minutes for all 52 packages. Set timeout to 30+ minutes.
  ```

### Core Analysis and Validation Commands
- Analyze all packages (primary CI operation):
  ```bash
  # Using the generated CI script - get all packages dynamically
  chmod +x ./tool/ci.sh  # Make script executable if needed
  PKGS="$(find . -name 'mono_pkg.yaml' | sed 's|./||; s|/mono_pkg.yaml||' | tr '\n' ' ')" ./tool/ci.sh analyze
  # NEVER CANCEL: Takes 15-25 minutes to analyze all 52 packages. Set timeout to 45+ minutes.
  ```
- Analyze a single package:
  ```bash
  cd <package_name>
  flutter pub upgrade  # Takes 30-60 seconds per package
  flutter analyze --fatal-infos .  # Takes 10-30 seconds per package
  ```
- Generate GitHub Actions (after adding new packages):
  ```bash
  dart pub global run mono_repo generate  # Takes 1-2 minutes
  ```

### Repository Management Commands
- Generate package list for README:
  ```bash
  dart pub global run mono_repo readme --pad
  ```
- Create new package:
  ```bash
  flutter create --template=package <your_package_name>
  # Then manually add mono_pkg.yaml with analyze stage
  # Then run: dart pub global run mono_repo generate
  ```

## Validation Scenarios

### Critical Validation Steps
After making any changes to packages, ALWAYS run these validation steps:

1. **Single Package Validation**:
   ```bash
   cd <modified_package>
   flutter pub upgrade
   flutter analyze --fatal-infos .
   # Both commands must complete successfully
   ```

2. **Full Repository Validation** (before committing):
   ```bash
   # NEVER CANCEL: This is the same process that CI runs
   chmod +x ./tool/ci.sh  # Make script executable if needed
   PKGS="$(find . -name 'mono_pkg.yaml' | sed 's|./||; s|/mono_pkg.yaml||' | tr '\n' ' ')" ./tool/ci.sh analyze
   # Expected time: 15-25 minutes for all packages. Set timeout to 45+ minutes.
   ```

3. **Markdown Validation**:
   ```bash
   # Check markdown formatting (runs in CI)
   markdownlint *.md  # If available, otherwise CI will catch issues
   ```

## Key Repository Structure

### Package Structure (All 51 packages follow this pattern)
```
act_<package_name>/
├── lib/                    # Main source code
├── test/                   # Test files (mostly minimal)
├── pubspec.yaml           # Package definition with "sdk: flutter"
├── mono_pkg.yaml          # Mono repo configuration with "analyze" stage  
├── README.md              # Package documentation
└── .metadata              # Flutter metadata
```

### Important Configuration Files
- `mono_repo.yaml` - Main monorepo configuration (defines analyze stage)
- `analysis_options.yaml` - Strict Flutter linting rules (very comprehensive)
- `.github/workflows/dart.yml` - Generated CI workflow (DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY)
- `tool/ci.sh` - Generated CI script (DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY)

### Generated Files (DO NOT EDIT)
- `.github/workflows/dart.yml` - Regenerated by `mono_repo generate`
- `tool/ci.sh` - Regenerated by `mono_repo generate`

## Common Operations

### Working with Packages
- All packages use `publish_to: none` (not published to pub.dev)
- All packages require Flutter SDK (`sdk: flutter`)
- All packages must pass `flutter analyze --fatal-infos .`
- Test files exist but are mostly empty (`void main() {}`)

### Integration with Projects
Projects consume these packages as git dependencies:
```yaml
# In consuming project's pubspec.yaml
act_abstract_manager:
  git:
    path: actlibs/act_abstract_manager
```

### Branch Strategy
- Create project-specific branches for consuming projects
- Regularly merge project branches back to master via merge requests
- Master branch should always pass all CI checks

## Timing Expectations and Timeout Values

### Command Timeouts (CRITICAL - NEVER CANCEL)
- `flutter doctor` (first run): 10+ minutes timeout
- `./tool/pub_get_all.sh`: 30+ minutes timeout  
- Full repository analysis: 45+ minutes timeout
- `dart pub global run mono_repo generate`: 5+ minutes timeout
- Single package `flutter pub upgrade`: 2+ minutes timeout
- Single package `flutter analyze`: 2+ minutes timeout

### CI Pipeline Timing
- GitHub Actions workflow runs analysis on all 52 packages
- Expected CI time: 20-30 minutes total
- Each package: pub upgrade (30-60s) + analyze (10-30s)

## Error Prevention

### Before Committing Changes
Always run these commands in sequence:
```bash
# 1. Ensure Flutter is available
flutter --version

# 2. Validate your specific package(s)
cd <your_package>
flutter pub upgrade && flutter analyze --fatal-infos .

# 3. Generate updated GitHub Actions if you added/modified packages
dart pub global run mono_repo generate

# 4. Run full validation (same as CI)
cd /path/to/repo/root
chmod +x ./tool/ci.sh  # Make script executable if needed
PKGS="$(find . -name 'mono_pkg.yaml' | sed 's|./||; s|/mono_pkg.yaml||' | tr '\n' ' ')" ./tool/ci.sh analyze
# NEVER CANCEL: Set timeout to 45+ minutes
```

### Common Issues and Solutions
- **Flutter not found**: Ensure Flutter is in PATH and `flutter doctor` passes
- **Package analysis fails**: Check `analysis_options.yaml` for strict linting rules
- **CI generation fails**: Ensure each package has valid `mono_pkg.yaml`
- **Network timeouts**: Use longer timeouts for all package operations
- **Script permission denied**: Run `chmod +x ./tool/ci.sh` to make CI script executable
- **Flutter download fails**: Try alternative installation methods or check network restrictions

## Repository Statistics
- **Total packages**: 52 Flutter packages
- **Main CI operation**: Analysis only (no building/testing of applications)
- **Package types**: All are library packages, no applications
- **Dependencies**: Heavy use of Flutter ecosystem packages
